# Sentiment Analysis Learning Project

This repository contains my learning project for sentiment analysis. I explored the basics of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) by analyzing Amazon product reviews.

## ‚ú® What I Learned
- Preprocessing text data (tokenization, cleaning)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, embeddings)
- Training and evaluating different models:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)
  - CNN-LSTM hybrid
- Comparing performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/darshan6122/sentiment-analysis-amazno-reviews.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-learning-project

2. Set up your environment:
   python -m venv venv
